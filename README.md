# Educational Technology Plan

The purpose of your educational technology plan is to outline the course that I will presumably teach in the 2023-24 school year as well as describe the necessary technological tools needed to implement it.

## Context

### Course

**A.P. Computer Science Principles**
>CourseNumber: GC721/2 
>Grades 9-11

AP Computer Science Principles offers a multidisciplinary approach to teaching the underlying principles of computation. The course will introduce students to the creative aspects of programming, abstractions, algorithms, large data sets, the Internet, cybersecurity concerns, and computing impacts. AP Computer Science Principles will give students the opportunity to use technology to address real-world problems and build relevant solutions.

### Situation

Provide relevant details about your course and/or school that will influence the
decisions in the plan. What assets and constraints do you face? What is the
context of your class, considering demographic and technical resources?


Every student in my school district is provided a chromebook and is offered a hot spot, regardless, not all students have reliable wifi at home. Thus, the majority of activities and assignments have to be done in class. Most students do not have prior experience with programming, so I will need to devote more time in the pacing to teach it.

## Plan

### Software Specifications

Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.


This course will be offered through the district's Oxnard Online portal (Canvas Learning Management System). Students will use 

### Hardware Specifications

Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary.


Students will primarily use their district assigned chromebooks.

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
