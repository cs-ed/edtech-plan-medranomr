# Educational Technology Plan

The purpose of your educational technology plan is to outline the course that I will presumably teach in the 2023-24 school year as well as describe the necessary technological tools needed to implement it.

## Context

### Course

**A.P. Computer Science Principles**

CourseNumber: GC721/2 

Grades 9-11

AP Computer Science Principles offers a multidisciplinary approach to teaching the underlying principles of computation. The course will introduce students to the creative aspects of programming, abstractions, algorithms, large data sets, the Internet, cybersecurity concerns, and computing impacts. AP Computer Science Principles will give students the opportunity to use technology to address real-world problems and build relevant solutions.

### Situation

Every student in my school district is provided a chromebook and is offered a hot spot, regardless, not all students have reliable wifi at home. Thus, the majority of activities and assignments have to be done in class. Most students do not have prior experience with programming, so I will need to devote more time in the pacing to teach it. A few students may have esperience with pyret because of the data science class offered on site, they will likely be able to adapt their previous knowledge.

Each school site in my district has an assigned IT Technician whose job it is to support all on-site devices. For Chromebook support, students and staff submit helpdesk tickets via a link on the district website or QR Codes posted in every classroom. Turn around is typically less than 48 hours and students may be issued a temporary chromebook while theirs is fixed. Students are also given the option to purchase yearly chromebook insurance through the Worth Ave. Group, this insurance replaces their chromebook indefinitely regardless of the reason. 

Aaaron Fergusson is the designated district canvas support provider and typically answers and solves canvas issues within 24 hours. Jay Sorensen is the district coordinator of educational technology, he answers most chromebook questions within 24 hours. Reina Berenjano is the district chief technology officer, and is the head of network support, she typically informs staff of planned and unplanned outages as well as expected uptime.

## Plan

### Software Specifications

This course will be offered through the district's Oxnard Online portal (Canvas Learning Management System). I will teach students from the free code.org curriculum. This curriculum has been adapted into canvas by Maya Crosby and I will use her course as the frame for mine. I will supplement AP test practice from the canvas course developed by Benjamin Smith.

### Hardware Specifications

Students will use their district assigned chromebooks.This is the Acer Chromebook Spin 511 model: R753T-C1PT 2 in 1 Chromebook. It has an Intel Celeron N5100 1.10 GHz Quas-core processor, an 11.6" LCD touchscreen, 8 GB of memory, and slots for microSD memory cards and USB flash disk drives. Its network requirement is a 
IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax connection. It has a microphone and front-facing camera.Its maximum battery run time is 12 hours, and it requires a 45W power supply to recharge. I have been provided with two chargers for students who need to charge their chromebooks.

### Application

The course has 10 modules, this consists of 5 units with 65 assignments. Given that my school site schedules AP testing in May, this means students must complete one assignment every two days. These assingments are typically activities wherein students work together to complete tasks or conduct research into topics that align to the college board's conceptual framework. Throughout the course students are given real life examples and relevant articles to read about the topics presented, they are given discussion prompts and time with their classmates to develop their understanding. Jigsaw activities will be used throughout the class to allow students to be exposed to all the reading material without having to do it all, having each team read one and present to the whole class solidifies their understanding. The district has enables the google read & write extension on all chromebooks so students can have online content read outloud to them.
Assessments are geared towards preparing students for the AP test and will ge graded using the college board's scoring guidelines.

### Impacts

The technology will help all students learn as they will access the content primarily through their chromebooks because there is no aligned textbook. Typically, the district wifi network is stable but in the case of it not working, I would adapt lessons to paper pencil/paper worksheets and/or printed articles. This should be possible as the wired connection has only ever gone down due to wildfires in the region, at that point school was cancelled, and neither students nor staff were expected to work.
